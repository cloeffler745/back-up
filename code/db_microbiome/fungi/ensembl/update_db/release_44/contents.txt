The one function listed in this directory is code that would update the ensembl database. 

The code is unfinished. I stopped when I realized that ensembl changed all their filenames on the update. 

If there is need for this again, the file in this directory is the working code. In directory works/ holds code that has been unit tested and works. 
Think of the code in works being the history of the code. But it only showed the parts where the code ran without any issues. Use these to reference
in case you change the code and it stops working.

My plan of attack was: 
- remove db entries that are not in updates
- check the matched entries and perform changes as necessary
- insert the new entries as usual
