move_files.sh
- the get_bact.sh code has all the files you want in a thousand subfolders. This code will pull all the files you want out and place into a single directory called "single_files" NOTE: the directory must already exist, and the directory "fasta" must be in the same directory as "single_files". It is in that directory that you run this code.
